            <li>Manekshaw was the <strong>Chief of the Army Staff</strong> of the Indian Army during the
                <strong>Indo-Pakistani War of
                    1971</strong>, and the first Indian Army officer to be promoted to the rank of field marshal. <br>
                His
                active military career spanned <strong>four decades</strong> and <strong> five wars</strong>, beginning
                with
                service in the <strong> British Indian Army in World War II</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>As a boy, Manekshaw was mischievous and high-spirited. His early ambition was to study medicine and
                become a doctor like his father</li>
            <li>He completed his primary schooling in <strong>Punjab</strong>, and then went to <strong>Sherwood
                    College, Nainital.</strong></li>
            <li>In <strong>1929</strong>, he left the college at the age of 15 with his <strong>Junior Cambridge
                    Certificate</strong>, an English language curriculum developed by the <strong>University of
                    Cambridge International Examinations.</strong></li>
            <li>In <strong>1931</strong>, he passed his <strong>Senior Cambridge</strong> (in the <strong>School
                    Certificate of the Cambridge Board</strong>) with distinction.</li>
            <li>Manekshaw entered the <strong>Hindu Sabha College</strong> (now the <strong>Hindu College,
                    Amritsar</strong>), and in <strong>April 1932</strong> sat his final exams held by the
                <strong>University of the Punjab</strong>, passing with a third division in science.
            </li>
            <li>Manekshaw applied for a place in Indian Military Academy (IMA) and sat the entrance exams in Delhi on 1
                October 1932.</li>
            <li>Manekshaw joined the first intake of the <strong>Indian Military Academy, Dehradun (IMA)</strong> called
                <strong>"The Pioneers"</strong> in <strong>1932</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>Manekshaw was commissioned as Second Lieutenants on <strong>1 February 1935.</strong></li>
            <li>Manekshaw joined the <strong>2nd Battalion, Royal Scots</strong> stationed at <strong>Lahore.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>On <strong>1 May 1938</strong>, he was appointed <strong>Quartermaster</strong> of his company.</li>
            <li>in <strong>October 1938</strong> Manekshaw qualified as a <strong>Higher Standard army
                    interpreter</strong> in <strong>Pashto</strong>.</li>
            <li>Because of a shortage of qualified officers on the outbreak of war, Manekshaw was appointed to the
                acting or temporary ranks of <strong>Captain</strong> and <strong>Major</strong> before promotion to
                substantive captain on <strong>4 February 1942.</strong></li>
            <li>He saw action in <strong>Burma</strong> in the 1942 campaign at the <strong>Sittang River</strong> with
                the <strong>4th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment</strong> and was recognised for bravery in
                battle.</li>
            <li>He led his company in a counter-attack against the invading <strong>Imperial Japanese Army</strong>.
                Despite suffering 50% casualties the company managed to achieve its objective.</li>
            <li>After capturing the hill, Manekshaw was hit by a burst of <strong>Light Machine Gun </strong>fire and
                was severely wounded in the stomach.</li>
            <li><strong>Maj. Gen. David Cowan</strong>, commander of the 17th Infantry Division, spotted Manekshaw
                clinging to life and, having witnessed his valour in the face of stiff resistance, rushed over to him.
                Fearing that Manekshaw would die, the general pinned his own <strong>Military Cross</strong> ribbon on
                him saying, <strong>"A dead person cannot be awarded a Military Cross"</strong>.</li>
            <li>Manekshaw was evacuated from the battlefield by Sher Singh, who took him to an Australian surgeon. The
                surgeon initially declined to treat Manekshaw, saying that he was badly wounded and his chances of
                survival were very low, but Singh forced him to treat Manekshaw.</li>
            <li>Manekshaw regained consciousness, and when the surgeon asked what had happened to him, he replied that
                he was <strong>"Kicked By A Mule"</strong>. Impressed by Manekshaw's sense of humour, he treated him,
                removing <strong>7 bullets from lungs, liver, and kidneys.</strong> Much of his intestines were also
                removed.</li>

                    Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) (3/5 GR (FF))</strong></li>
            <li>During his term at the MO Directorate, he was promoted to <strong>Colonel</strong>, then
                <strong>Brigadier</strong> when he was appointed as the <strong>First Indian Director of Military
                    Operations.</strong>This appointment was later upgraded to <strong>Major General</strong> and then
                to <strong>Lieutenant General</strong>, and is now termed <strong>Director General Military Operations
                    (DGMO)</strong>
            </li>
            <li>He became commander of <strong>167 Infantry Brigade</strong> in <strong>1952</strong> and served in this
                position until <strong>1954</strong> when he took over as the <strong>Director of Military
                    Training</strong> at <strong>Army Headquarters.</strong></li>
            <li>After completing the higher command course at the <strong>Imperial Defence College</strong>, he was

                    Bhushan</strong> in <strong>1968</strong>.</li>
            <li>Manekshaw became the <strong>7th chief Of The Army Staff in 1969.</strong></li>
            <li>In the capacity of COAS, Manekshaw once visited a battalion of 8 Gorkha Rifles in <strong>July
                    1969</strong>. He asked an orderly if he knew the name of his chief. The orderly replied that he
                did, and on being asked to name the chief, he said <strong>"Sam Bahadur"</strong>. This eventually
                became Manekshaw's nickname.</li>
            <li>Under his command, Indian forces conducted victorious campaigns against <strong>Pakistan</strong> in the
                <strong>Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</strong>, which led to the creation of <strong>Bangladesh</strong> in
